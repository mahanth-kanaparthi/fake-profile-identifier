        <h3>What Are Fake Profiles?</h3>
        <p>
            Fake profiles are fraudulent online accounts impersonating real people or organizations. 
            They are created for malicious activities like scams, misinformation, trolling, phishing, or identity theft.
        </p>

        <h3>Impact on Social Life</h3>
        <p>
            Fake profiles erode trust in online communities, spread false information, harass individuals, 
            and damage reputations. Their unchecked growth threatens digital wellbeing.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Detect Them?</h3>
        <p>
            Detecting and reporting fake profiles helps maintain a safer social media environment. 
            It protects people from scams, defamation, and cybercrimes, and ensures accountability.
